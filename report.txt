[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] for your answer
	[] crashes when?
	[] infinite loop when it should not?
	[] only works in printed mode?
	[X] work fine?
	[] only implemented these options: [please list them]
	[] other? Explain.


How does your move strategy work? Describe briefly in English.

    I alterneated between finding the first and last vacant spot.
    I did this by passing an int that was 1 or 0 to my function that made the
    move, a 0 looped through the array in reverse order, a 1 looped in standard,
    normal order.
    I added 1 and did modulus 2 to the int every time a move was made to make 
    it loop the other way the next time.



============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?
    I think the movement of the agents was the most revealing thing about the
    simulation because you could physically see the new locations and compare
    the city from one cycle to the next.





============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?
    I learned how to use ncurses and getopt.
    I alse learned how to break a C program up into several different files.
    I also learned what the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm is.



What was easy about this assignment?
    To me, the easy part of this assignment was implementing the code to find
    the happiness of the chars and the city, as well as the code to move the
    agents to a new spot. Really the implementation of the algoritms needed was
    easy.



What gave you problems or troubles?
    Some of the C syntax, I tried to include _DEFAULT_SOURCE twice because I 
    split the code into several files and that caused issues that I had to 
    figure out how to fix.



What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?
    Clearer instruction on example output, for example, the print mode output
    that was supplied was not replicable but was not stated which led to 
    confusion about the program not outputing correctly.



What would you have liked to do in this assignment?
    I would have liked to have more than 2 types of agents, or possibly
    obstacles in the 'city' that act as border and separate the agents.
